### 🚶 Now Bring It All Together
➤ SGD
You stand at your current position.

Feel the slope under your feet (gradient),

Step in that direction with a fixed stride.

No memory. No caution. Just move.

➤ Momentum
Same as above, but now:

You remember your previous direction.

If you’ve been going the same way, you build momentum and move faster.

Helps smooth out jerky steps on noisy trails.

➤ Adam
You’re an intelligent hiker:

You build momentum in consistent directions 

You monitor how rough the trail has been using squared gradients 

If the trail’s been rough lately, you reduce your stride.

So you go faster on smooth trails and slow on rough ones — all while steering in the average best direction.

➤ AdamW
Same as Adam, but:

You now also slowly adjust your position toward the center (origin) at every step — simulating weight decay.

This keeps you from wandering too far off course, even if the slope feels safe.

In other words: you correct your position every step, nudging yourself to stay closer to home, regardless of terrain.
